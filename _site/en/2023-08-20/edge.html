        <h2 id="why-write">Why Write</h2>

<p>The browser is likely the most frequently used application on many people‚Äôs computers. For those of us with a penchant for optimization, we often tinker with our work tools until they‚Äôre in a state of peak usability. Last year, I wrote about my journey tinkering with Mac software. After a year of iterations and changes, I plan to continue writing this year, especially since a friend recently asked me which browser I use. So, let‚Äôs start with ‚ÄúMy 2023 Browser Tinkering Journey.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-a-useful-browser">Characteristics of a Useful Browser</h2>

<p>Aside from the current browsers generally having no issues with compatibility, including security aspects where they‚Äôre more or less the same, what characteristics do I believe make a browser useful?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Speed is paramount</strong>: The speed of opening web pages must be fast, which is the primary criterion. It should not feel sluggish, imparting a sense of swiftness akin to a cheetah.</li>
  <li><strong>Highly configurable</strong>: I should be able to turn off anything I don‚Äôt need. Even if the default initialization isn‚Äôt great, it should all be disable-able.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing</strong>: It must be straightforward, with a predictable interface where I can find what I need immediately, and the window display should not be unattractive.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="browsers-ive-used">Browsers I‚Äôve Used</h2>

<p>I conducted a questionnaire survey last Saturday, retrieving 948 responses, primarily from engineers or those interested in IT. The results were more or less as expected, with an additional 40 or so respondents expressing a strong preference for Firefox.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.fliggy.com/upic/xXOt4T.png?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_3600/format,webp" width="900" /></p>

<p>Most respondents likely use the Chrome browser, which is simple, user-friendly, and reasonably fast after downloading. However, its performance is actually just average, especially evident when I used a 2019 model Mac for comparison. I also have a particular fondness for vertical sidebars, as the top tab bar feels like a waste of space to me.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also extensively used the <a href="https://arc.net/">ARC</a> browser, a super stylish browser with outstanding interaction design. However, I usually find myself unable to continue using it after a few days, satisfying the aesthetic requirement but falling short in operational certainty and swiftness compared to traditional browsers.</p>

<p>Besides these, there‚Äôs Firefox, my favorite browser during my university days when I was a Windows user. However, I stopped using it later due to extension compatibility issues and inconsistent standards in frontend development. I‚Äôve also tried Opera, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/zh-hans/">Vivaldi</a>, and <a href="https://brave.com/zh/download/">Brave</a>. I gave up on Opera because it doesn‚Äôt support sidebars, Vivaldi was too customizable and hence too complicated for my liking, and Brave was okay if you value privacy and supports sidebars, but I didn‚Äôt find it very attractive and eventually gave up on it. Additionally, there‚Äôs Safari, highly favored by many Apple developers for its simplicity, but its incompatibility with Chrome extensions and the need to install an app for each extension made me abandon it as well.</p>

<h2 id="my-final-choice">My Final Choice</h2>

<p>Last year, my journey with Mac software introduced Edge as my browser choice, and surprisingly, it remains Edge this year. I have a love-hate relationship with this browser; the hate comes from its very Microsoft-style approach‚Äîgreat for showcases but messy in actual use, with a default effect that feels cluttered. <strong>However, thankfully, all the extra features can be turned off, and with significant UI upgrades this year, the speed feels genuinely swift. Plus, the support for vertical side tab bars</strong> makes it meet my criteria for a ‚Äúuseful browser.‚Äù However, reaching this state requires considerable configuration work, which is why I‚Äôm writing this article.</p>

<p><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/05/j1GSyM.png?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_3600/format,webp" width="900" /></p>

<h2 id="starting-configuration">Starting Configuration</h2>

<p>If you haven‚Äôt installed Edge yet, you can download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download">official version</a>. After downloading, I suggest logging in to the sync feature first. If you don‚Äôt have a Microsoft account, create one to save your configurations and prevent loss when switching to a new machine.</p>

<p><strong>Before starting the configuration, to ensure a smoother transition, I recommend syncing your previous browsing history and bookmarks to the new browser. You can click the first tab on the menu bar <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft Edge</code>, choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Import browser data</code>, and import the records from your previous browser, akin to one-click moving.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Of course, if you‚Äôre accustomed to Chrome, except for the section ‚ÄúTurning off all the unnecessary stuff,‚Äù the following can also be applicable</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-all-the-unnecessary-stuff">Turning Off All the Unnecessary Stuff</h2>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+.</code> to enter the settings page, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Profiles</code> turn off Microsoft Rewards to minimize distractions.</li>
  <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Privacy, search, and services</code>, aside from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracking prevention</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft Defender Smartscreen</code>, turn everything else off, <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/8f/SCR-20230818-nzug.png">screenshot of the effect</a>.</li>
  <li>Continue in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Privacy, search, and services</code> to the bottom, find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Address bar and search</code>, change the search engine in the address bar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Google</code>, which is significantly better than Bing, <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/db/o8kr1v.png">as shown in the screenshot</a>.</li>
  <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Appearance</code>, turn on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Try the new Microsoft Edge appearance</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show profile icon in the title bar</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show profile switcher in the profile button</code>, set page zoom to 110% (if you have a high-resolution Mac, a bit of zooming will feel more comfortable), in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Customize toolbar</code> enable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hide the title bar in vertical tabs</code>, enable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show all open browser windows in vertical tabs</code>, turn off all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Choose what to show on the toolbar</code>, turn off all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Context menus</code>, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Customize browser</code> turn on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tab stops highlight links and form fields on webpages</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Use double click to close browser tabs</code>, turn everything else off, final configuration <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/14/ORSLHn.png">screenshot</a>.</li>
  <li>Continue in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Appearance</code> to the bottom, choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Customize fonts</code>, which should be empty by default, you can change all fonts to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Helvetica Neue</code>, and monospace font to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JetBrains Mono</code>, <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/t0/n1OVak.png">screenshot of the effect</a>.</li>
  <li>Continue in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Appearance</code>, find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hover menu</code>, you can turn everything off there, <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/2g/CIr88d.png">screenshot of the effect</a>.</li>
  <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sidebar</code>, if you‚Äôre someone with OCD, I suggest turning everything off here, then click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Discover</code> to turn off <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show Bing Chat</code>, <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/hl/Ly6T61.png">screenshot of the effect</a>, <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/nd/q8xMtt.png">Discover screenshot</a>.</li>
  <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System and performance</code>, you can configure the optimizations according to your situation, you can refer to <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/wa/9ExeYQ.jpg">my configuration</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the above steps, your new browser should become much cleaner, haha, Edge‚Äôs product managers might want to chase me down with a 30-meter-long sword after seeing this.</p>

<h2 id="finding-some-useful-extensions">Finding Some Useful Extensions</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs not recommended to have too many extensions, only the essentials, to avoid running efficiency problems or even making it difficult to troubleshoot page bugs. Furthermore, it‚Äôs advisable not to install extensions directly from the Edge store but to get them from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a> for a richer and safer experience. The following 6 extensions are ones I use a lot, which I can briefly introduce.</p>

<p><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/r9/639shots_so.png?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_3600/format,webp" width="900" /></p>

<h3 id="maple-bookmarks"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maple-bookmarks/lgncmpklmepncbjpiebhdoejhmbcnjad">Maple Bookmarks</a></h3>

<p>Maple Bookmarks is a bookmark management extension I wrote two years ago but have been using locally until recently, when I decided to upload it to the Chrome store for friends to use. The main reason is that <strong>the browser‚Äôs default bookmark bar blocks my view</strong>. Having it directly exposed on the page easily distracts me when I‚Äôm working on something, so I usually hide the default bookmark bar and use this extension for a smoother browsing experience.</p>

<p>After installation, simply press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + E</code> to quickly access bookmarks, even with immediate search capability, practical and convenient, like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.fliggy.com/upic/m67PaC.gif" width="900" /></p>

<p><strong>Before using it, it‚Äôs advised to organize your bookmarks, adjust the commonly used order, and delete the less frequently used ones, placing folders at the back</strong>. Then, hide the bookmark bar with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+Shift+B</code>, and it‚Äôs also recommended to show <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maple</code> in the Toolbar for easy access.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>if you find Edge‚Äôs default new tab page too ugly, you can switch to my <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maple-newtab/fobmbldflolfooglijmbibmnhoflbjlb/">Maple Newtab</a></strong>, which supports blank clean pages, Trendy Weekly images, Bing images as background options. Place the cursor on the background image, wait for 2s for the switch box to appear, and click to switch.</p>

<h3 id="immersive-translate"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/immersive-translate/bpoadfkcbjbfhfodiogcnhhhpibjhbnh">Immersive Translate</a></h3>

<p>This extension is the most amazing and powerful Chrome extension I‚Äôve encountered this year, and also the best web page translation plugin. After downloading, it‚Äôs highly recommended to follow its setup instructions, set up convenient shortcuts, and it‚Äôs advised to use the ChatGPT mode for translation, which works very well.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.fliggy.com/upic/cjwf6Q.gif" width="900" /></p>

<p>For more detailed usage, you can visit the <a href="https://immersivetranslate.com/">Immersive Translate</a> official website, which is almost entirely free to use.</p>

<h3 id="ublock-origin"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">uBlock Origin</a></h3>

<p>How could a browser exist without an ad-blocking plugin? However, many ad-blocking plugins are memory-intensive and not as lightweight or customizable as I would prefer. I‚Äôve been using uBlock Origin for several years, an efficient network request filtering tool that uses minimal memory and CPU.</p>

<p>Once installed, you can go into the extension settings and turn off options you deem unnecessary. Also, in the rules list, select only the main filtering rules, such as those with ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù or ‚Äú‰∏≠Êñá‚Äù. <strong>If you want to simplify the process, you can download my <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/k/1/my-ublock-backup.txt">my-ublock-backup</a> and choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Restore from file...</code> in the settings to overwrite directly</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/xi/4bIm7s.png?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_3600/format,webp" width="900" /></p>

<p>With this, if you encounter unblocked ads or non-ad elements you wish to hide, you can directly right-click to customize and hide things you don‚Äôt want to see.</p>

<h3 id="violentmonkey"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag">Violentmonkey</a></h3>

<p>Violentmonkey is one of those tools that you don‚Äôt realize how powerful it is until you start using it. I had heard about userscripts long ago but hadn‚Äôt really used them until I encountered situations where they became essential. Once I started, I couldn‚Äôt stop. With its ability to inject JS, you can do a lot, and there are many scripts already written by others.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.fliggy.com/upic/Z32EE3.png?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_3600/format,webp" width="900" /></p>

<p>However, I don‚Äôt recommend installing too many scripts. Currently, I mainly use these 7 scripts, and you can selectively install as needed. Additionally, it‚Äôs advisable to turn on the sync feature in the extension settings for easy use on a new computer. <strong>If you prefer not to bother, you can import my pre-configured <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/k/lc/violentmonkey.zip">backup file</a></strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/471782-twitter-x-blue-bird">Twitter X -&gt; Blue Bird</a>: If you use Twitter, replace the Twitter X logo with a little blue bird.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="minimal-theme-for-twitter"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-theme-for-twitter/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp">Minimal Theme for Twitter</a></h3>

<p>If you‚Äôre on Twitter, don‚Äôt miss this extension. It can transform your ugly Twitter page into a very clean one. My configuration <a href="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/lf/nYtapH.png">looks like this</a>, and you‚Äôre welcome to copy it.</p>

<h2 id="the-very-end">The Very End</h2>

<p>There are many efficient ways to use a browser, such as becoming familiar with shortcuts. Here are some I frequently use that you might find helpful to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+L</code> for quick searches of history, bookmarks, and URLs.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+T</code> to open a new tab.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+Y</code> for history.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+Shift+B</code> to toggle the bookmarks bar.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command+Shift+J</code> for downloads.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + Shift + N</code> for incognito mode.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + Number</code> to jump to a specific TAB page.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + Shift + Delete</code> to clear browser history.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command + Shift + []</code> to switch between tabs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, I‚Äôve bookmarked some commonly used pages that help me improve efficiency or for learning and reading:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://shots.so/">Shots</a>: Most screenshots in this article were beautified and standardized using this tool.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots">Dribbble</a>: A go-to for design ideas and inspiration.</li>
  <li><a href="https://app.daily.dev/onboarding">Daily.dev</a>: For reading international tech articles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://macosicons.com/#/">macOSicons</a>: For finding attractive icons for Mac apps.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/zh-cn/">Pexels</a>: For royalty-free images.</li>
  <li><a href="https://undraw.co/illustrations">unDraw</a>: For simple, attractive SVG illustrations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a>: For compressing images.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.iconfont.cn/">Iconfont</a>: An increasingly useful icon download site.</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting used to quick browser operations and remembering your commonly used sites can significantly enhance your browsing experience. However, I suggest not following my methods entirely but selecting based on your preferences. Still, it‚Äôs worth tinkering with, as it can be quite fun. If you have any browser tips you find useful, feel free to discuss and share ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>
