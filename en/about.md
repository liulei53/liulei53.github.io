**About Me**

• I have never worked as a software engineer, but I have been engaged in data center operations for ten years.

• Once a programmer, always a programmer. I still have an endless passion for technology.

• I believe in the unity of heaven and man, enjoy outdoor activities, sports, and love nature.

• I record my learning, life, and experiences on my personal blog. If you’re interested in my content, feel free to follow me.
